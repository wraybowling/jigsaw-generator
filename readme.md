The Jigsaw Synth is a procedural tool for generating a physical jigsaw puzzle. Patterns can then be exported to a computerized cutter or a template to be cut by hand.

Pieces are laid out in a grid then randomness is added by drawing pieces with voronoi cells. Various other settings turn piece edges into interlocking tabs. Puzzle Synth let's the user blend between big, small, easy, hard, wiggly, woggley, lumpy, or whatever.
